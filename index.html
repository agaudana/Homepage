        <h1><i>Who is Aarav Gaudana?</i></h1>
        <p>   My name is Aarav Gaudana and I am a computer geek. Apart from programming, I like reading.
             Out of the Big Four, I am more of a Google-Microsoft fan, which is why we have 4 Microsoft products and 6 Google products in our home.
             We have one Amazon product and one Apple product (Which is defective) compared to that.One of my other favorite things to do is origami. It makes that
            joy of creating something feeling that you also get when programming. I like to code with my friend Kyle. My first website (which is incomplete) I made was the 
            most of that feeling I got: <a href="https://agaudana.github.io/PaperAirplaneProfessor/">My First Website</a>
